# Genshin Scraper - README

## About Genshin Impact

Genshin Impact is miHoYo's first ever open-world game, where beliefs in "The Seven" converge in the fantasy world of Teyvat. The devastation that once swept the land has finally ceased. Wounds have healed, but the peace that should have fallen over the city of wind, Mondstadt, did not arrive. The domineering Fatui have risen up in the name of "defense" to oppress other city-states. Traveler, the time has come to begin your own adventure with Paimon in this new land!
